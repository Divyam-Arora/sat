Designed to handle hard work and unpredictable weather, each back rack is built with custom jigs for every truck model on the market, giving you the best fit on the market! Unlike other models, it can be used with a tonneau cover and includes brake, signal, and reverse lights. The all-aluminum welded construction and powder coated finish gives you a tough, light weight rack that delivers when you need it most. The Magnum Truck Back Rack with Lights \u2013 Low Pro was designed to not only work hard but to turn heads while doing it. Truck cab protection never looked this good until Magnum!
